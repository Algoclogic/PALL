Installation
--------
PALL is available on Packagist (using semantic versioning), and installation via composer is the recommended way to install PALL. Just add this line to your composer.json file:
```
"require": {
        "algoclogic/pall": "dev-master"
    }
```
or run
```
composer require algoclogic/pall
```

Note that the vendor folder and the vendor/autoload.php script are generated by composer; they are not part of PALL.

Register the providers: 
put
```
Algoclogic\PALL\Providers\PALLServiceProvider::class,
```
in providers array of {{YourProjectName}}/config/app.php file.



publish the changes by running the commands:
```
composer dump-autoload
php artisan vendor:publish
```
At last take a look at the generated .env and fill the fields related to amazon with the information you got from your amazon account.

That is all. You are ready to go and run the API.
